FMU Ensemble is a Python module for handling of simulation ensembles 
originating from an FMU (Fast Model Update) workflow. 

Ensembles consist of realizations. Realizations consists of input and
output from their associated *jobs* stored in text or binary files.

This module will help you handle ensembles and realizations (and their
associated data) as Python objects, and thereby facilitating the use
use of other Python visualizations modules like webviz.
